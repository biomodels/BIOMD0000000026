The model corresponds to the schemas 1 and 2 of Markevich et al 2004, as
described in the figure 1 and the supplementary table S1. Phosphorylations and
dephosphorylations follow distributive ordered kinetics. The phosphorylations
are modeled with three elementary reactions:  
E+S<=>ES->E+P  
The dephosphorylations are modeled with five elementary reactions:  
E+S<=>ES->EP<=>E+P
